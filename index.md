### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorites because we learned how to use classes and I got a better understanding of how classes work. I also got to use double, int, and float. We even got to use std::string but I feel like making our own would have been really cool and I hope to do that in the future.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was also another favorite of mine because we got to work with files and I really enjoyed learning more about them. In this lab we were able to write and save a message on the file. This lab is my favorite because it introduced me to files and it will help me in the future with bigger projects.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was another favorite of mine because we got to create a hilo game that implemented if and else statements. I really enjoyed coding this lab because after I finished coding it and saw the game running I was in shock because I coded a small game and I felt proud of myself.
